# adapt
An easily-readable, modular pipeline to reduce some data from the ARCTIC camera on APO.

The data reduction portion of this does almost exactly what acronym 
(Weisenburger et al. 2017, https://github.com/kweis/acronym) does, with the exception of 
performing an overscan subtraction before trimming. I wrote this to be slightly more explicit 
(read: slower) so that a PreMAP student can run any portion of the reduction and see what it does.
If you want to reduce ARCTIC data and you are not my PreMAP student, PLEASE use Kolby's code!

Hell, even if you are my PreMAP student, try Kolby's code too!
